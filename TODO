- Add support for more build-packs (e.g. RoR)

- Security: Ensure `sudo` privilege is revoked before container is launched

- Security: Make apps run as 'ubuntu' (or other non-privileged user)

- Split up installation scripts:
    1 for shipbuilder server
    1 for load-balancer
    1 for nodes

- Consider switching from BTRFS to ZFS (maybe support both?)

- Add support for hipchat deployment notifications

- Add host ip, port, & process type to `logs` output

- Ensure non-essential container services are disabled before container is launched

- Speed up commands by maintaining persistent SSH tunnel: We could eliminate the time it takes the client to login to the SB server to run a command by having an option to maintain the SSH tunnel (even perhaps just for some period of time?) so that a new connection is not required everytime a command is run.
